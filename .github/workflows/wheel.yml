  # First we build the wheels natively (build system == host system).
  # This allows us to import the compiled modules, and automatically generate
  # stub files for them. Those stub files are then included in the sdist
  # (source distribution), to be later included in the cross-compiled packages
  # as well (because we can't generate stubs while cross-compiling).
  # By building the native wheels first, we can already start testing while the
  # cross-compiled versions are being built.
